# C++ Multidimensional Arrays

## Two Dimensional Array

**Example**
    ```
    int x[3][4];
    ```

>Here, x is a two-dimensional array. It can hold a maximum of 12 elements.
---

## Three-dimensional Array

**Example**

 ```
 float x[2][4][3]; 
 ```

> This array x can hold a maximum of 24 elements.

**Example**

---
    int  test[2][3] = { {2, 4, 5}, {9, 0, 19}};
---

*[*] This array has 2 rows and 3 columns, which is why we have two rows of elements with 3 elements each.

```
int test[2][3][4] = {3, 4, 2, 3, 0, -3, 9, 11, 23, 12, 23, 
                 2, 13, 4, 56, 3, 5, 9, 3, 5, 5, 1, 4, 9};
```
